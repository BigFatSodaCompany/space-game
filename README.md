SPACE-GAME
==========

> _A clone of that game I play in that bar._

Introduction
------------
This is loosely based upon the game I play in that bar in which I drink. With
some obvious improvements inspired by that game I used to play.

The Plan (in phases)
--------------------

1. Get the first level made into a playable state:
   + Create an intro screen, a loading screen and a level screen
   + Radar & HUD
   + Do some sort of AI for enemies
   + 1st person perspective only
   + Weapons
   + Models and sounds (simple attenuation)
2. Add 3rd person perspective
3. Add missiles
4. Add split-screen multiplayer (2 players):
   + One ship from the **Pastry Dominion**; the other from the **Vegetable Rebellion**.
   + Head-to-head mode
5. Add 'barrel-roll' move
6. Add split-screen co-op multiplayer (2 players):
   + **Vegetable Rebellion** only
   + Adjust AI for multiplayer
7. Add difficulty levels
8. Create subsequent levels
9. Add 4-player multiplayer/XBL multiplayer
